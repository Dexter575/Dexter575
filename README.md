I am a software tool developer having degree in computational sciences and simulation engineering with focus on research and development of intelligent algorithms. I have a strong passion for programming and simulation in engineering. My skill set includes mathematical modeling, algorithms development and its implementation in C++/Python. I love crunching FDM, FEA, FVM by writing HPC code and that is exactly where my expertise lies i.e., developing computational physics simulations.
